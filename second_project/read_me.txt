Introduction to Machine Learning - TensorFlow Project
In this folder there has been developed the second application for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. This requires to first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, and then convert this into a command line application.

In order to succesfully complete this project, GPU enabled workspaces is provided within the classroom workspace. In this folder all necessary files are available, but if you choose to use your local CPU the application is unlikely to work correctly.

GPU mode has to be used only when you needed. If you are not using the GPU, please disable it so you do not run out of time!

Data
The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large you cannot upload it onto Github. If you would like the data for this project, you will want download it from the workspace in the classroom. Though actually completing the project is likely not possible on your local unless you have a GPU. You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. Then you will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.
